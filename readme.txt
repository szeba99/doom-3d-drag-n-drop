1. Static models, no animation
2. Make sure the textures and the models have the same name.
	-model.md3
	-model.png
   Zscript actor name will be the same.

3. Drag and drop everything into the .py file

4. The .py file automatically detects which one is texture by the extension, creates the folder structure, generates zscript and modeldef code for a static (like decorative) model. Or you can edit the script to suit your own needs.
